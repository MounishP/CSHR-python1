Program Statement: Library Management System

Design and implement a Library Management System in Python to manage a collection of library items, patrons, and library staff. The system should support the following functionalities:

Library Items:

Create and maintain a catalog of library items, including books and magazines.
Each library item should have a title, an author (for books) or a publisher (for magazines), and a status indicating whether it is checked out or available.
Implement methods to check out and check in items.


Patrons:

Register patrons with the library, each having a unique name.
Patrons should be able to:
Check out library items.
Return library items.
View a list of items they have checked out.


Library Staff (Librarian):

Create a librarian who has limited patron privileges.
Librarians cannot check out items but can perform other actions, such as registering patrons.


Library:

Create a library entity to manage the catalog of items, patrons, and the librarian.
Display the library catalog, including the status of each item.
Display a list of registered patrons.
Allow the librarian to assign a librarian to the library.


Main Program:

Create instances of library items (books and magazines), patrons, and a librarian.
Add these instances to the library.
Demonstrate the functionality of the library system by:
Patrons checking out and returning items.
Displaying the catalog and registered patrons.
The librarian trying to check out items (which should be disallowed).


Inheritance:

Implement inheritance to create classes for library items (e.g., Book and Magazine) that inherit from a common LibraryItem class.
Use inheritance to create a Librarian class that inherits from the Patron class but with limited functionality.
The program should showcase the use of conditional statements, loops, inheritance, and object-oriented principles to create an interactive and functional library management system.
